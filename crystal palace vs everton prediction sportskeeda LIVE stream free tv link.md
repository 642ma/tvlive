How to watch the Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Everton, as well as kick-off time and team news.

Everton are back in action just days after the dramatic conclusion to the Merseyside derby, as they make the trip to Selhurst Park to take on Crystal Palace in Saturday's Premier League showdown.

The Eagles have put together a solid campaign under Oliver Glasner, despite losing their talisman Michael Olise to Bayern Munich over the summer. Sitting on 30 points from 24 matches, Palace had a rough start to the season, managing just one win in their first 13 league outings. However, Glasner has steered them to stronger performances, particularly in cup competitions.

Palace reached the League Cup quarterfinals, edging past Aston Villa (2-1), QPR (2-1), and Norwich City (4-0) before suffering a narrow 3-2 defeat at Arsenal. In the FA Cup, they have a Fifth Round clash with Millwall after seeing off Doncaster Rovers (2-0) and Stockport County (1-0).

Everton endured a similarly sluggish start but have begun to turn things around, largely thanks to a managerial shake-up. The Toffees parted ways with Sean Dyche and brought back David Moyes, marking an emotional homecoming for the Scotsman after more than a decade away.
